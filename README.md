# TinyURL DSA — Java Project

This is a simple Java console application that works like TinyURL. It lets you shorten long URLs and retrieve them using a short code. I also added some extra features using basic data structures like HashMap, LinkedList, and PriorityQueue.

I built this project to apply DSA concepts in a practical way and improve my Java skills.

## Key Features

- Shortens long URLs using a random 6-character short code
- Retrieves original URLs from short codes
- Tracks how many times each short URL is used
- Displays the top 3 most used short URLs
- Shows the 5 most recently shortened URLs
- Lists all stored mappings

## DSA Concepts Used

- HashMap – for storing short code ↔ URL mappings
- LinkedList – to keep track of recent links
- PriorityQueue – for sorting top-used links
- StringBuilder & Random – to generate short codes efficiently

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed
2. Save the code as `TinyURLDSA.java`
3. Open terminal in the project folder
4. Compile the code:
